Cloud-FEA
=========

**Design of an Open-source FEA Optimization tool for Cloud Computing**

Similar to previous project, but this project focusses on running a open-source FEA program on a cloud computer cluster. Thus, time consuming FEA optimization problems can be run in parallel and the optimum design can be achieved in a very short amount of time without the need of setting up expensive work-stations

The project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).
